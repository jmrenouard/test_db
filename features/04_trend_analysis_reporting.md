# Feature: Historical Trend Analysis in Reports

## Context
Currently, the `make analyze` command generates a performance report for the current run only. There is no easy way to track if performance is improving or degrading over time.

## Objective
Enhance the reporting system to save historical performance data and include a trend analysis section in the generated report.

## Execution Prompt
You are a Data Engineer. Your task is to add historical tracking to the performance reporting script.

### Instructions:

1.  **Modify `scripts/generate_reports.py`**:
    - **History Storage**: Implement a function to read/write a JSON file (e.g., `reports/history.json`).
    - **Data Structure**: Store an entry for each run containing: `timestamp`, `total_execution_time`, `total_issues_count`, `queries_count`.
    - **Update Logic**: At the end of the analysis, append the current run's metrics to the history file.

2.  **Enhance Report Output**:
    - In the Markdown summary (`reports/performance_report.md`), add a new section "📈 Historical Trend".
    - Display a table showing the last 5-10 runs.
    - (Optional) If possible, calculate the % change from the previous run (e.g., "Time: 1.2s (+5%)").

3.  **Requirements**:
    - Handle the case where `reports/history.json` does not exist (create it).
    - Keep the history file reasonable in size (maybe limit to last 50 entries).
    - **Rules**: Strictly follow the rules in `.agent/rules/*.md`.
    - **Dependencies**: Do not add new pip dependencies (like pandas/matplotlib) unless absolutely necessary. Stick to standard library `json` and `math` if possible.

4.  **Output**:
    - Updated `scripts/generate_reports.py`.
    - A sample `reports/history.json` (can be generated by running the script once).
    - Updated `Changelog`.
